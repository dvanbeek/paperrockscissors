The initial project structure revolves around a more domain centric design,
which makes it convinient for future improvements but is also kept simple
since the problem to be resolved was simple on it's own. 

If this was to evolve into a more complex problem, this design could easily
evolve into a event-driven which would resolve the problematics of having multiple players, 
and different game configurations at once.
